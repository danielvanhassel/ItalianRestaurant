Simple schoolproject for PRA which requires us to set requirements with a mock client and execute those requirements for a simple webapp.
Uses javascript to fetch html sections for the 'menukaart' so they can be displayed.
Uses a simple javascript function so users can type a text in a textbox and download that text as a .txt file.
